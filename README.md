# dcc-free-domain
A unique domain name for you

## What is dcc-free-domain?
DCC Free Domains can provide you with domain names such as `*.mtr.pub`,`*.monika.love`,`*.ddlc.love`,`*.ddlc.top`. You can create DNS records for A, CNAME, TXT, SRV, etc.
**But**, except for `mtr.pub`, other domains must have at *LEAST* a little association with [DDLC](https://ddlc.moe) in order to claim.

## How to get one
1. Fork this repo.
2. Edit the file corresponding to the record you want to add (A, CNAME, TXT, SRV, etc.)
3. Send Pull Request.
